      <h2>5 Easy Spring Cleanup Tips for a Healthier Lawn</h2>
      <p class="small muted">Posted: January 16, 2026</p>

      <p>
        Spring cleanup is a great time to refresh your yard after winter. Start by removing leaves and debris,
        trimming dead plants, and edging garden beds for a clean look.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add a fresh layer of mulch to hold moisture and reduce weeds. If your lawn has thin or patchy areas,
        consider overseeding or small-area sod to bring it back quickly.
